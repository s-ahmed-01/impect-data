## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Impect](https://www.impect.com)
- **Format**: JSON
- **Coverage**:
  - Bundesliga 2023/24
- **Data Points**:
  - Event Data
  - Event KPIs
  - Team Lineups & Substitutions
  - Match Info
  - Player Info
  - Squad Info
  - Country List
  - Iteration List
  - KPI Definitions

## How to Use the Data

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ImpectAPI/open-data.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
   ```sh
   cd open-data
   ```
3. **Load Data in Python (Example)**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   # read data
   df = pd.read_json("data/events/events_122838.json")
   
   # print first 5 rows to console
   print(df.head())
   ```

## How to Use the Data with [Kloppy](https://kloppy.pysport.org/)

[Kloppy](https://kloppy.pysport.org/) by [PySport](https://pysport.org/) is _the_ industry standard open-source fooball data standardization package. Kloppy simplifies football data processing by offering a single place to [**load**](https://kloppy.pysport.org/user-guide/loading-data/impect/), [**filter**](https://kloppy.pysport.org/user-guide/getting-started/#filtering-data), [**transform**](https://kloppy.pysport.org/user-guide/transformations/coordinates/) and [**export**](https://kloppy.pysport.org/user-guide/exporting-data/) your football data in a standardized way. 

To get started with the open dataset simply,
 
1. **Install Kloppy**
   ```sh
   pip install kloppy>=3.18.0
   ```
   
2. **Load the data**
   ```python
   from kloppy import impect

   events = impect.load_open_data(match_id=122840)
   ```

   To load other, non-open data use `impect.load()` instead.

3. **Filter, Transform and Export**
    ```python
    df = (
        events.transform(
            to_orientation="STATIC_HOME_AWAY"
        )  # Now, the home team always attacks left to right
        .filter(lambda event: event.period.id == 1)  # Only keep frames from the first half
        .to_df(
            engine="polars"
        )  # Convert to a Polars DataFrame, or use engine="pandas" for a Pandas DataFrame
    )
    ```

## Data Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

```
