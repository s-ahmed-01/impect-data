            "label": "Expected Passes",
            "definition": "A model-based estimate of how many passes and set pieces a player is expected to complete successfully, given the difficulty of each attempted pass. The model evaluates contextual factors such as pass distance, angle, opponents, pressure, distance to goal, distance to side lane, phase of play, action, and attempted receiver positon to assign a completion probability to every attempted pass. EXPECTED_PASSES is the sum of these probabilities across all passes in the selected period.",
            "meaning": "Expected passes provide a statistical benchmark for assessing passing performance. By comparing expected passes with a player\u2019s actual successful passes, we can measure whether the player is completing more or fewer passes than the model predicts. To do this, two derived scores are useful: Pass Completion Over Expected and Pass Accuracy Over Expected. These scores capture whether a player is performing above, in line with, or below the expected baseline, and help highlight technical passing skill, decision-making, and ability under pressure. Example: If a player attempts 10 passes and completes 8, while the model predicts 7.5 expected completions, then: Pass Completion Over Expected = (8 \u2013 7.5) / 7.5 = +6.7% and Pass Accuracy Over Expected = (8 \u2013 7.5) / 10 = +5%."
